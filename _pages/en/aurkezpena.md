### Presentation of the indicators 

On the homepage of this platform, by selecting each of the 17 Goals, you can access the targets established for each goal and the corresponding indicators. The vast majority of the indicators included in this platform are those established by the UN at the global level; some European indicators are also included, as well as some Basuqe Governmet's specific indicators. 

The data available for the Basque Country do not always exactly correspond to the measurement criteria established for global and European indicators. In these cases, the indicator presented for the Basque Country is the closest available. 

The relevant data for each indicator are presented in a graph and a table. For some indicators, this presentation is complemented by an interactive map showing data for counties or municipalities. Both new data and updates to already published data are added as soon as they have been obtained and verified. 

Some indicators cannot be represented using data. When this is the case, explanatory texts with links to thematically relevant information about the indicators are displayed. 

At the bottom of each indicator page the following tabs are displayed: 

-	Methodological sheet: provides information on the indicator available in the Basque Country and how it is calculated. 
  
-	Data sources: Links to the organization(s) that provided the data for the indicator and, where possible, direct links to the specific data sources. 
  
-	More information: Contains the description and justification for the global or European indicator, an assessment of whether the indicator available in the Basque Country meets the requirements of the United Nations (or European Union, as applicable) indicator, and the international results. It also includes information on the calculation of the global indicator. 

### Assessing progress on the SDGs 

The platform includes a monitoring report that provides an overview of progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the Basque Country.
