## Introduction   
The [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/), adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a blueprint for improving the economy, society, and the environment in a sustainable manner. At its heart, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people globally can enjoy peace and prosperity.  

The goals are underpinned by a framework of global indicators that allow BC and other countries to monitor and report on progress. They cover a broad range of social, environmental, and economic issues with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment to “leave no one behind”. To complement the global goals, countries are encouraged to develop a national implementation plan that focuses on country-developed indicators to address specific national contexts and priorities to achieve the SDGs.  



## Measuring Progress   
Measuring and monitoring progress with reliable information is key to understanding how the BC advances toward the achievement of the SDGs.  

Closely monitoring the progress of each indicator not only illustrates where BC is making progress or areas where progress is not being made and BC can focus its efforts, but also communicates how BC is doing in an open and transparent manner. A robust measure of progress quantifies an indicator’s progress towards reaching the target in a scientific manner and can used as a tool to better understand success of policies and actions taken to achieve those targets. It can also act as a clear signal to decision-makers to re-adjust or develop effective evidence-based policies to help ensure Canada achieves its targets.  
 



## Methodology Adopted   
The  Indicator Framework System lays the foundation for BC to measure and report its progress on the 17 SDGs within the BC context. The CIF focuses on BC priorities for sustainable development and can be considered a complement to the Global Indicator Framework. In the CIF the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are complemented by 31 ambitions and 76 indicators that are specific. However, unlike the Global Indicator Framework where every indicator has a target, less than half of the indicators in the CIF currently have a defined target, either quantitative (e.g., target 11.5 *By 2030, 22% of commuters adopt shared or active transportation*) or aspirational (e.g., target 5.2 *Greater representation of women in leadership roles*).  

To complement the CIF, Statistics BC has developed a robust and simple method of measuring progress which can be reported using visualizations that allow data users to easily see areas of progress or weakness. Even in the absence of specific quantitative targets, an estimate of progress can inform whether undesired trends are being observed by reporting progress deterioration. In essence, this measure of progress provides a simplified illustration of Canada’s progress toward achieving the SDGs, assuming that the current trends are maintained.  



### Requirements   
Eustat identified essential requirements for the adopted methodology. The guiding principle for the methodology was the necessity of a consistent and easily interpretable measure that could reach a broad audience while maintaining scientific integrity.  

More specifically, the methodology must:  

1. Allow for different data periodicity and timeliness: Data series available in BC have various collection calendars and reference periods. Some are collected every year while others every few years. Furthermore, the time required between the collection of data and release of official statistics varies greatly between programs.  
2. Provide a calculation for measuring progress in the absence of a quantitative target: To gain a greater understanding of policy impacts and progress towards the achievements of the SDGs, it is crucial to be able to assess progress in the absence of a specific numerical target.  
3. Allow for the calculation of an aggregate measure, whether at the target, ambition, or goal level: When used appropriately, a composite measure of progress is valuable to leaders and policymakers to help steer policy and actions towards making progress to achieve the SDGs.  

  
The adopted methodology cannot rely on:  

1. The need to create a target when there is none. As a statistical agency, we remain politically neutral. Therefore, it is outside the scope of our mandate to assign targets. Thus, the methodology must be valid even in the absence of a target.  
2. Indicator-specific thresholds for progress categories: It was assessed that using different criteria for each indicator would put too much emphasis on the method rather than the message and overall progress. Therefore, the methodology developed uses a straightforward and consistent method across all indicators.  
3.	The existence of extended time-series: Many issues covered in the SDGs haven’t been measured for an extended period. Opting for a methodology that is robust despite a shorter time-series allows for a considerable increase in the number of indicators for which progress can be calculated.  
4.	Modelling: Similar to item 3, modelling usually requires a longer time-series which will reduce the number of indicators eligible for calculation of the progress measure.  


### Methodology   
The progress measure consists of a measure of observed growth compared to an evaluation of the proximity to achieving the target under current conditions. In situations where no quantitative target is provided, the time series is evaluated on the apparent trend of the data.  
  
Keeping in mind the limited number of data points in each time series and a desire to keep the methodology simple and transparent, the optimal methodology for measuring progress closely mirrors the progress methodology used by Eurostat[^1].  

Progress is measured using the growth over the observed period and is calculated by a compound annual growth rate,  


where  
*CAGR*<sub>o</sub> is the observed compound annual growth rate between *t<sub>0</sub>* and *t<sub>i</sub>*     
*y<sub>ti</sub>* is the value of the indicator at time *t<sub>i</sub>*    
*t<sub>i</sub>* is the most recent year where data is available, and    
*t<sub>0</sub>* is the base year, 2015, unless otherwise specified.

#### Indicators with quantitative targets  
In the case where a quantitative target for the indicator is provided, the observed *CAGR<sub>o</sub>* is compared to the theoretical *CAGR<sub>r</sub>*, which represents the growth required to achieve the target, by calculating the ratio (*R<sub>o/r</sub>*) as follows:   


where   
  

*x<sub>tT</sub>* is the target value of the indicator in the target year, *t<sub>T</sub>*.
