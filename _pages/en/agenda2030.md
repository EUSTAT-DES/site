The [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment), adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a blueprint for sustainably improving the economy, society, and environment. At their core, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people everywhere can enjoy peace and prosperity. 

The goals are supported by a framework of global indicators that allow progress to be monitored and reported on. They cover a wide range of social, environmental, and economic issues, including, but not limited to, poverty, hunger, health, education, social equality, innovation, climate change, biodiversity, and justice, with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment to leave no one behind. Governments are also encouraged to develop an implementation plan, which may include indicators developed to address specific contexts and priorities for achieving the SDGs.

In the Basque Country, the Basque Government has, from the outset, directed its efforts and projects towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the targets of the 2030 Agenda. Thus, [Lehendakaritza](https://www.euskadi.eus/eusko-jaurlaritza/berrikuntza-soziala-2030-agenda/) leads the actions of the Basque institutions in relation to the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.

To monitor progress towards the SDGs in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, Eustat â€“ Basque Institute of Statistics carries out a specific statistical operation (see [operation's methodology file](https://en.eustat.eus/fm_099901_i.html)) and has developed the [United Nations Global Indicator Framework](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata) indicator platform for the Basque Country and its provinces. A significant portion of the indicators has been defined using a methodology harmonized across all central statistical bodies of the Autonomous Communities, ensuring full and direct comparability of these indicators at the regional level (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/doc/OCECA_es.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Agreement of the central statistical bodies of the Autonomous Communities (pdf, 14Kb)</a>). Also included, either directly among the United Nations indicators or as related indicators, are the [European Union Sustainable Development Indicators](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi) as well as the Basque Country's own indicators, developed in coordination with the [Euskadi Agenda 2030 Forum](https://www.euskadi.eus/eusko-jaurlaritza/berrikuntza-soziala-2030-agenda/) to monitor the Lehendakaritza's objectives. 

The indicator framework is constantly expanding, both in number and level of disaggregation, in line with Eustat's unequivocal objective of providing quality, integrated, and comparable information, both temporally and spatially, and adapted to the monitoring needs of our society.
