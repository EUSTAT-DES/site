<div class="container">
<p>Disaggregation means showing data from different subcategories separately to enable more detailed analysis; for example, differentiating data for women and men, or for minors and adults.</p>
<p>This platform aims to offer disaggregated data by different variables, but this is not possible for all indicators. This is the list of indicators for which disaggregated information by province is currently available; it is a growing list that will be expanded as new disaggregated data become available.</p>
